# Wanna-be-a-millionaire  -  Python Project

Want to be a millionaire game  -  Python Project programmed using Tkinter

It has the options for calling a friend, 50/50 and ask the public

It can be improved a lot, as calling a friend option gives you a random response and ask the public option gives you random percentage on each answer

The list of questions/ answers can be edited and can be written in other languages besides English

The game has a timer of 2 minutes for each question and it changes the amount of dollars won if the answer is right

I'm planning to make the options more usefull in the near future, so it won't be so much random; besides the 50/50 option they don't help too much

I'm also planning to make the list of questions for each category, for example: History, Sports, Geography, Did you know?, Animals and so on

Another feature that can be implemented is to change the background once you reach certain levels in the game so it will be more fun to play

The main part of the project is done but I'm planning to add some of the extra features mentioned above to improve it

I've attached below a image of the game after answering correct the first question. Hope you like it. Enjoy :)
